## Overview
Problem: Students in college tend to desire to have some advice from their predecessors but usually there is no central forum to check for notes/studying resources pertaining to the class/subject that the student is struggling with, usually people have to make do with finding alumnis of the class by luck

Solution: Our solution is the Peer To Peer Study Material Exchange Site which is an application designed for UH Manoa students to solve the absence of a centralized hub to post study material content for courses by allowing their fellow students to gather insight from their experiences that they can post on the site

## Mockup page ideas
Possible pages would include,
- Landing Page
    - The page that contains either a welcome to site post, or a few example posts of notesharing/study materials
- Sign In Page / Sign Up Page
    - In order to post your notes/study material in the site, you would have to create or log in to an acoount where you're information is saved and made public if you post on the site
- Profile Page
    - The page will display the sign up information(personal details) and subjects currently taking
- Browse Page
    - This page will be the primary browsing feature of the site, where you filter through posts by choosing sections/topics/classes that you would like to see study materials for
- Saved Posts
    - This will be the page where your favorite posts are saved and can be viewed
- Add Post
    - This page will allow logged in users to post through a form

## Use case ideas
The user would first appear on the landing page, where they would proceed to either sign in/ sign up on the sign in page with their personal infornation, Where they can go to the profile page to optionally double check the information is right. Finally they can either add a post themselves, or browse for the post of the subject they desire through the browse page, save it if they want to and view it on their saved posts page any time.

## Beyond the basics
- Private messaging the author of the post through direct messaging
- Having an anonymous option to post, direct message other students
- A rating system similar to reddit where we can view the positive opinions of posts, or a report function to report posts to admins to take down if inappropriate
