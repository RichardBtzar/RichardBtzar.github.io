## Game Development

My interests in software engineering stemmed from my usage of everyday technology and software. Technology is a part of many people’s daily lifestyle including 
myself.  As I have gotten used to the impact that technology has on my life, I grew to take an interest in specific software engineering aspects. In childhood, I 
frequently played video games in my free time, it had been a hobby of mine to where I could relax and unwind. Because of this interest, when I first delved into 
computer science, game development had become an interest of mine. Over time I practiced with the unity game engine and dabbled through other engines like unreal.
Building a game felt like a valuable skill I wanted to cultivate, adn I hhope to learn more in the future.

## Mobile App Development

Other than game development, I had other interests that I hoped to learn, one of these were mobile app development. When I first experienced using a smartphone, 
apps were something that astonished me. It was a total shift towards my usual routine, events that could have taken hours like depositing money in my bank account 
could be done with a few flicks of my finger on the bank’s mobile app. But the apps that I spent my most time on were asian webtoon/webcomic apps, they provided a 
convenient quick and easy recreational activity to do in between classes. I admired the design and layout used to make the app appealing alongside the world that 
was posted on these positions. My experience with these apps caused a surge of interest towards learning mobile app development in hopes to eventually create 
something similar. I hope to gain more insight into the technology needed to create these apps.

## VR/AR Development

My latest and final interest was VR/AR software development. VR/AR development peaked my interest when it initially hit mainstream eyes with the oculus rift back 
in the mid 2010s. Looking at the VR headset providing an immersive environment gave me the thought that this would be the next evolution for visual entertainment. 
It would be upgrading the visual experience from staring at a screen to having a 360 degree dynamic vision into games and other sources of entertainment.
I had hands on experience using a VR headset, and through this demo I has, I found myself intrigued by the immersion I felt in that period of time. I predicted
that VR had been in the path to becomming something that wasn't just science fiction. AR on the other hand, came to my field of vision a little later. On 2016 when 
Pokemon Go released, it was the first experience with an AR software that appealed towards my personal interests. The world had been taken over by this software, 
it also brought a passion for mobile AR applications I never knew would exist in me. AR and VR were technologies I felt embodied the future, and I want to lear 
more about them as time goes on.
