## Overview
Problem: Students who want to travel or study abroad usually have no prior experieence that helps dictate which country satisfies their desires

Solution: Our solution is the Peer To Peer Foreign Experience Exchange Site which is an application designed for UH Manoa students to post about the experiences they had in traveling/studying in other countries

## Mockup page ideas
Possible pages would include,
- Landing Page
    - The page that contains either a welcome to site post, or a few example posts of some students experiences
- Sign In Page / Sign Up Page
    - In order to post your expereiences on the site, you would have to create or log in to an acoount where your information is saved and made public if you post on the site
- Profile Page
    - The page will display the sign up information(personal details) and the countries you have interest in studying abroad at
- Browse Page
    - This page will be the primary browsing feature of the site, where you filter through posts by choosing sections/countries that you would like to see the experiences of other students on
- Saved Posts
    - This will be the page where your favorite posts are saved and can be viewed, you would be able to add/delete any post
- Add Post
    - This page will allow logged in users to post through a form that gathers information such as country location, title, and the text of the post

## Use case ideas
The user would first appear on the landing page, where they would proceed to either sign in/ sign up on the sign in page with their personal infornation, Where they can go to the profile page to optionally double check the information is right. Finally they can either add a post of their own experience in another country, or browse for the posts of the subject they desire through the browse page, save it if they want to and view it on their saved posts page any time.

## Beyond the basics
- Private messaging the author of the post through direct messaging
- Having an anonymous option to post
- A rating system similar to reddit where we can view the positive opinions of posts, or a report function to report posts to admins to take down if inappropriate
- Maybe a ranking/leaderboard to help determine the most popular countries
